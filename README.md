Welcome to my Sign Up Form project! 

This mini project aims to create a user-friendly sign up form with basic client side validation using HTML and CSS.

### Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Other tools used:
  
  * Github Pages for free hosting
  * Git for version control
  * Figma for mockup
  * Chrome DevTools for debugging
  * Visual Studio Code for IDE

### Motivation
To practice and solidify my HTML Forms and  and CSS fundamentals

### My Learnings
* Value of HTML Forms
* Value of CSS function clamp for dynamic sizing
* Usefulness of Chrome DevTools for checking layout
* Usefulness of other CSS selectors, e.g. child combinator and pseudo-class selector
* Importance of client side validation as a first-line of filter and gateway for the back-end
* Importance of font fallback

### Known Issues
* Not mobile responsive
* No validation for password

### Prospective Updates
* Make mobile responsive
* Use Javascript to check if passwords are similar

# Usage
To test the built-in basic HTML client side validation, try submitting empty values.

When you submit the form, it will also check if the user inputted an at(@) sign on the email input.

When you submit the form, it will also check if the user inputted minimum required characters on the phone number input.
